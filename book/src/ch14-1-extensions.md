# Extensions and reductions

*Milestone M5, after stage 20 · on `main`, no stage tag · code in `crates/engine/src/search.rs`*

Chapters 12 to 14 made the tree smaller by guessing which moves and positions don't need a full
search. This chapter changes the depth itself: an **extension** searches a move *deeper* than
its siblings.

The technique in this chapter came after stage 20, as strength work towards version 1.0
(milestone M5), so no stage tag contains it: read this chapter against `main`. Like everything
before it, it can be switched off and on: `set checkext`.

## Check extensions

A move that gives check is searched one ply deeper than the moves around it. A check leaves the
opponent few replies, so the extra ply costs little, and checks are where the horizon hides
mates and lost pieces: a mating attack is a run of checks, and stopping halfway through one
evaluates a position whose point hasn't happened yet.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../crates/engine/src/search.rs:check_extension}}
```

The child is then searched at `depth - 1 + extension`. The `ply < MAX_PLY / 2` condition
matters: an extension that can apply at every ply never reaches the horizon, and a long series
of checks would grow the search without bound.

Philidor's legacy shows what it buys. White mates in four, and every move is a check: 1. Nf7+
Kg8 2. Nh6+ Kh8 3. Qg8+ Rxg8 4. Nf7#.

```text
> fen 4r2k/6pp/8/3Q2N1/8/8/6PP/6K1 w - - 0 1
> ab checkext 8
```

With the extension the engine sees the mate at depth 8; without it, it needs a deeper search.

**cb2026 ships with it off.** Extending every check made the bench search about 24% bigger, and
an SPRT with the extension on against the same engine without it found no gain (see "What it's
worth" below). Most of what it finds is found anyway: late move reductions never reduce a move
that gives check (chapter 13), and the quiescence search resolves the captures. Strong engines
extend more selectively, for example only checks that don't lose material, or only **singular**
moves: a move that a reduced search, with that move left out, shows to be much better than every
alternative. The switch stays, so the experiment can be repeated.

## What it saves

The six positions of chapters 10 to 14 (the first six bench positions) at depth 8:

| Setting | Nodes | vs defaults |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Defaults (check extension off) | 193,361 | — |
| `set checkext on` | 207,017 | +7% |

On the bench (14 positions at depth 10) the extension costs more: 24% more nodes.

## Pitfalls

- **Search explosion.** An extension that can apply at every ply never reaches the horizon, and
  one that applies often can double the tree. Limit extensions (here, to the first half of the
  maximum ply), and count nodes as well as games.
- **Overlap.** Every technique here works on top of all the others. The check extension found
  little because LMR already spares checks; turning a technique off shows only what it adds *on
  top of* the rest.

## What it's worth

| Test | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Check extensions on vs off (stage 20), 8+0.08, cloud, SPRT [0, 5] | −8.3 ± 17.7 Elo over 840 games (+229 −249 =362), no verdict when the session's two-hour limit stopped it: no gain, so it is off by default |
